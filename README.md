# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Proj
Statement:- Hotel Booking analysis Project deals about understanding the booking patterns, guest preferences, and factors influencing cancellations to enhance decision-making and improve the overall guest experience.

Objectives:
1.Analyze Booking Patterns: To identify and comprehend the most popular booking sources, channels, lead times, and hotel kinds among guests.
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights on the most prevalent ways guests book their stays, as well as the timing of their bookings.

2.Investigate Guest choices: Determine the meal choices, guest composition (including adults, children, and newborns), and average daily rates (ADR) that guests desire. 
This investigation is critical for adapting services and offerings to match the expectations of guests.

3.Recognize the Factors Influencing Cancellations: To look into the reasons that contribute to booking cancellations, such as market segments, previous booking history, and other effects. 
Understanding these variables is critical for lowering cancellation rates and increasing income.


 Significance
Understanding and optimizing booking patterns, guest preferences, and cancellation factors are crucial for the hotel industry. This analysis can help hotel managers and staff make informed decisions to improve guest satisfaction, revenue, and operational efficiency. Key areas of significance include:

1. Revenue Optimization: Knowing which types of rooms, meal plans, and special requests bring in the most money can lead to targeted marketing and pricing strategies.
2. Cancellation Management: Analyzing factors that influence cancellations, such as lead time and deposit type, can assist in reducing revenue losses and increasing room utilization.
3. Improved Guest Experience: Knowing your guests' preferences for meals, parking, and room types can lead to a better overall experience, potentially leading to positive reviews and repeat business.
4. Operational Efficiency: Monitoring booking trends and sources can help with staffing and resource allocation. It can also help with effective waiting list management.


Steps to Connect to Data

Here are the few Steps I performed before connecting the data

 Data Collection and Preparation:

Data Sources
The project's data was collected from the AccioJob Git repository. Two versions of the data were obtained: CSV and SQL. These datasets provided essential information related to hotel bookings, guest details, meal preferences, booking sources, room details, and reservation status.

Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was a crucial step to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset. This process involved:

- Removing duplicates and irrelevant records.
- Handling missing values by imputing or eliminating them.
- Addressing data mismatches and inconsistencies.
- Validating data types and formats to conform to project requirements.

Data Transformation
After data cleaning, data transformation was carried out to enhance the dataset for analysis and reporting purposes. Key transformations included:

- Adding calculated attributes and measures to facilitate analysis.
- Merging and joining data from different sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Standardizing data units and formats for consistency.
- Creating a clean and structured dataset suitable for analytical purposes.
